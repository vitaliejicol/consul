# Audit Logging

<EnterpriseAlert>
  This feature is available in all versions of <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/consul/">Consul Enterprise</a>.
</EnterpriseAlert>

Audit logging captures a clear and actionable log of authenticated events (both attempted and committed) that Consul processes and compiles them into a JSON format for easy export. These events contain a timestamp, the operation performed, and the user who initiated the action.

Audit logging provides greater insight and accountability for security teams that are concerned with automating service networking tasks.

For more details, review the [Consul Server Configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options) documentation and the [Audit](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/options#audit) configuration.
